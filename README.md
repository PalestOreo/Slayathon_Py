# Slayathon_Py
This is the first iteration of Slayathon, developed entirely in python, Slayathon Py.
This version is and entirely text-based rogue-like, so if you die, you die, nothing gets carried across runs.
There is another version of this in development, you can find more information about that version here: sites.google.com/view/slayathon-official/home
